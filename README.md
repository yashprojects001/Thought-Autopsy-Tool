## 🧠 What is this?
**Thought Autopsy Tool** is an experimental psychological web experience that treats thoughts like evidence.

Instead of *comforting* you, it **examines** your thought:
- What belief is hiding underneath?
- What assumption is silently running the show?
- What cognitive distortion is warping reality?
- How heavy is the emotional load?

No accounts.  
No databases.  
No artificial intelligence.

Just **cold clarity**.

## 🩸 The Core Idea
> “A thought isn’t truth. It’s a suspect.”

This project visualizes mental patterns the way a forensic lab analyzes a crime scene.

You don’t fix the thought.  
You **understand** it.
